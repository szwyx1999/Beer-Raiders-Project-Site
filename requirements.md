## Initial Requirements

------

##### **Context of Product**

Our team's product will be used in a home or school/workplace environment. The product is a playable game that will be hosted on a Personal Computer. I say that the environment includes the school or workplace because many users will play our game on their laptop. The laptop has the ability to be carried along to different environments. There are many environments that I have not listed that could be listed, but for simplification I have limited the environments to home or workplace. 

##### **Domain Model with Description**

The above UML Class diagram depicts the game system mechanics. The BeerRaiders class has a relationship with Alien class in that the player attacks the enemies. The multiplicity on the enemies end indicates that there will be 1 or more enemies attacking one Player. At all times, there will be only one player attacking one or more enemies. The _check_bullet_alien_collisions association class indicates that the moment a player attacks and hits an enemy, the moment is recorded as points scored. The points is added to the score member. This member is accessed by creating an instance of GameStats in the BeerRaiders class. Each enemy has a specific amount of points to give to a player, once the enemy is destroyed. The points will be added to an aggregate score that the player has access to within the class. An instance of the GameStats class is set as an attribute at the onset of BeerRaiders attributes creation and assignment. The GameStats composition class is indicative of the upkeep of an aggregate score. During the player's game, the score will accumulate to a specific amount and grant the player one extra health (future feature). The PointsNeedToExHealth attribute is representative of a constant and the score attribute is checked against the PointsNeedToExHealth attribute to find if the player is successful at reaching the required amount of points specified in the PointsNeedToExHealth attribute. 

The _player_hit association class indicates the player is penalized with a loss of health the moment an enemy's attack hits the player. The player has a specific amount of health at the beginning of the game. An aggregate beers_left attribute is used to keep track of the current health assigned to the player. This attribute is made accessible through the same instantiation of the GameStats class that was created at the onset of attributes creation and assignments. Remember, the player can obtain more health by accumulating points given to a player by the destruction of enemy sprites. A aggregate association of Player to BeerRaiders class is indicated by the clear diamond at the receiving end of the BeerRaiders class. This relationship indicates, as does the GameStats to BeerRaiders aggregate association, the BeerRaiders class has an instantiation of the Player class as an attribute. The Player class has an exclusive instance of Bullet class assigned as an attribute during Player class attributes creation and assignments. Therefore, the Player will have to have access to a bullet attribute and update() method. 

The Settings class contains all the initial values set for health, bullet speed, player speed, and alien speed. There are two types of settings housed within the Settings class. Most settings are set statically, meaning there is no need for changing of these settings throughout the game. Dynamic settings are changed throughout the game because of the possibility of a person moving to another level, or the player being hit by an enemy. The dynamic settings are the beer_limit, player_speed, and alien_speed attributes. The player_speed and alien_speed attributes are changed in the increase_speed() by a constant value of 10%.

The PowerUp Dropped (future feature) association class is dependent on the attacks issued by the Player to a blimp. This relationship indicates that there will be an item dropped the moment the blimp is hit by a player attack. The next appearance of a blimp is reliant on the time the previous blimp appeared in the game. The PowerUp (future feature) to Player aggregate association indicates that the player will become attributed with powerups throughout his or her gameplay. In fact the instantiation of the PowerUp class begins the moment there is an instance of the Player object class. The powerup will have a 1 to 1 relationship with the Player.  This means the player will be granted one powerup ability at a time. Each powerup remains in use for a specific amount of time or until the player collects a different powerup. The invincibility powerup will always last for a specified amount of time. Whereas, the rapid fire powerup will last until the player is hit with an enemy attack. The Blimp class (future feature) will generate the Blimps carrying the powerups onto the screen at specific time intervals to allow for the player to obtain different powerups.    

The Mothership enemy types (future feature) inherits class members and methods from the Aliens superclass. This is indicated by the sub-type relation contained between them and the Enemies class. Moreover, GameStats and PowerUp classes can be implemented as sub-classes of BeerRaiders, but the preferred implementation is to have it be an aggregate of the BeerRaiders class. 

##### **User Characteristics and Expectations**

The skills of the user of the game vary from semi-skilled game enthusiasts to new and un-skilled gamers. The game's controls are easy to understand, and the game's user interface does not have components that need explaining. The components are self explanatory because there are labels for score and Health. Powerups that are obtained by the player would be described at the beginning of the game through the use of an instruction screen. Instructions displayed will be player movement controls and descriptions of each powerup and their effects on the user.

I understand that the user will want some functionality in terms of different levels and increasing difficulty as levels progress. This expectation was addressed in the user stories document. It is of importance to ensure a player is presented with a steady playthrough without having too great of a challenge as well. That is why having an increase of powerups appear during the higher difficulty levels is important. The process of finding out the playability of the game will be further inspected by conducting interviews with the players who play the game.
