#### 1: Progressive Difficulty between levels

**Elaboration:**  The first level should not be hard, but the proceeding levels should increase in difficulty. The difficulty will provide a player with many hours of gameplay, since there will be numerous attempts to defeat all levels. The challenge of completing all levels will provide players with the sense of accomplishment.

**Constraints:** The levels cannot be too hard, otherwise the player will not want to play the game anymore due to extreme frustration.

**Effort Estimation:** 3 person-hours

**Acceptance Test:** Perform attempt at completing all levels. The completion of lower levels within the 1 hour period is sufficient. The completion of the higher difficulty levels will be attempted in the next 2 hour block. The accumulation of lives lost up to the boss fight will indicate that the player placed a meaningful effort in progressing through the levels.

####  2: Good Life Mechanics

#### 3: Boss Fights

As a player, I want to be confronted by an intimidating enemy so that I may test my skills in defeating a challenge that is presented in the form of a menacing figure.

**Elaboration:** This menacing figure is a large spaceship. The spaceship will be the final boss in the game. To ensure a player is faced with a challenging enemy, my attempt at destroying the figure will result in me accumulating a certain amount of deaths. 

**Constraints:** The player cannot obtain a high amount of deaths, because he/she will get upset with the difficulty of the Boss. This result leads to the player quitting the game and not returning to play it again.

**Elaboration:** The core actions, such as shooting, jumping, or enemy deaths, should have a corresponding sound effect that matches the action. Picking up extra health and lives should result in a congratulatory sound effect to indicate a good action. On the other hand a player's death should result in a bad sound effect that indicate an unwanted action. 

**Constraints:** Cannot have sound effects for everything. This would saturate the game with sound effects and create a game that is non-playable.

**Effort Estimation:** 4 person-hours
