# 					<u>Project: Beer Raiders</u>

**Problem Statement:**

- ###### Introduction

  A game programmed in Python that is a clone of the classic Space Invaders game. The game will serve as a project submission for the *NMSU CS 371 Software Development* class. Project creation will be a collaborative effort made by a team of students. Our team's name is CYDJ, and the team members' names are: Chris Davila, Yuxi Wang, Daniel Almeida, and Julio Estrada. 

  Our team's game is a 'spin' on the classic Space Invaders game. The game is called "Beer Raiders", and will consist of a team of 'alcohol induced' aliens that will gradually progress towards a town to steal a collection of beer shipments. The protagonist is a robot that frequents the establishment to obtain his share of the 'frothy' goodness. The game will be programmed entirely in python.

- ###### General Description

  The game will have a menu screen that depicts a Megaman style character named 'Beer Defender', and loads of alcohol crates in the background. The menu will have a start game option. The game will commence once the user clicks the start option. The game will have both menu and in-game music. The player will have animations for walking left and right, and jumping. The protagonist will have to move out of the way or jump over specific traffic coming from both right and left sides. 

  The incoming traffic will be trucks that contain special pickups and the protagonist will have to collide with it for him to collect the special. Specials will be extra hearts, score multiplier, and temporary invincibility. The trucks with good specials will be colored blue and bad specials will be colored red. The bad special pickups will be inability to jump, or consecutive shooting is halted for a specific amount of time.  

  The aliens will come down in the same pattern of space invaders and shoot at the player at random. "Beer Defender" will start each wave with three protective barriers to protect him against the enemies' attacks. Unfortunately, the barriers will only protect against a certain amount of attacks before it blows up. Our protagonist will have oil cans to represent hit points. Each laser that hits the protagonist will remove one oil can. Player will start out with 3 oil cans for each level. The player dies when he or she loses all oil cans. The player will also have lives at his or her disposal. The player can obtain lives after reaching a certain amount of points. The game is over when the player loses all his or her lives.

  The ones that do reach a certain area of the screen will take a case of beer to the mothership. When all the cases are stolen the protagonist summons his space ship to go after the aliens in space. Here the game becomes a speed run. The player must retrieve the crates of beers before the aliens reach the mothership. The game is over when the aliens reach the mothership.

  If the player survives the 3 oncoming waves of aliens and prevents them from taking the beer. The player will board a space ship and soar out into space to fight the mother ship in a boss fight. The fight will go on till the mother ship is destroyed or the player loses all his or her oil cans.
