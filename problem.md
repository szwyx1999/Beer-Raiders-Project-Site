# 					<u>Project: Beer Raiders</u>

**Problem Statement:**

- ###### Introduction

  A game programmed in Python that is a clone of the classic Space Invaders game. The game will serve as a project submission for the *NMSU CS 371 Software Development* class. Project creation will be a collaborative effort made by a team of students. Our team's name is CYDJ, and the team members' names are: Chris Davila, Yuxi Wang, Daniel Almeida, and Julio Estrada. 

  Our team's game is a 'spin' on the classic Space Invaders game. The game is called "Beer Raiders", and will consist of a team of 'alcohol induced' aliens that will gradually progress towards a town to raid a brewery. The protagonist is a drunk, named 'Beer Defender', that frequently visits the establishment to obtain his share of the 'frothy' goodness. The game will be programmed entirely in python.

- ###### General Description

  The game will have a menu screen. The menu will have a start game option. The game will commence once the user clicks the start option. The game will eventually have both menu and in-game music. The player will have animations for walking left and right. The protagonist will have to obtain powerups from blimps that enter the playing area at random intervals (future feature).

  After shooting the blimp, the protagonist will have to collide with the falling powerup to collect the special. Specials will be score multiplier(optional feature), rapid shooting, and invincibility. Invincibility will only protect against a certain amount of attacks before the ability is no longer applied to the player. The rapid shooting powerup will remain in effect until the player gets shot and loses health (beer).

  The game will have similar enemy and player mechanics as Space Invaders. The aliens will move towards ground level in a side to side movement. Enemies begin movement to the right edge of the screen where they will begin to move to left side of screen, after collision with right side of screen, and vice versa. The enemies will shoot lasers at the player at random (future feature). 'Beer Defender' has the option of attacking each enemy with a gunshot. The total amount of bullets allowed on screen are four bullets. The rapid shot power up will allow for more bullets to be allowed on screen. Three bullets will be shot out of the gun in succession during the rapid shot powerup. 

  Player will start the game with a specific amount of beers (three three-packs). The beers represent the player's current health, and a three-pack will be removed when the player is hit with an enemy laser. The game is over when the player loses all beers. When an enemy collides with the player, meaning it successfully reached the player's height, then the player loses a three-pack (health).  

  After a certain amount of levels, the game will continue in space with the player controlling a spacecraft. The player will attempt to defeat a large spaceship. The large spaceship will be the final boss (future feature). The boss will have a heavy attack (missiles) and light attack(lasers). During the fight, some smaller spaceships will enter the playing area and attempt to kill the player.
