# 					<u>Project: Beer Raiders</u>

**Problem Statement:**

- ###### Introduction

  A game programmed in Python that is a clone of the classic Space Invaders game. The game will serve as a project submission for the *NMSU CS 371 Software Development* class. Project creation will be a collaborative effort made by a team of students. Our team's name is CYDJ, and the team members' names are: Chris Davila, Yuxi Wang, Daniel Almeida, and Julio Estrada. 

  Our team's game is a 'spin' on the classic Space Invaders game. The game is called "Beer Raiders", and will consist of a team of 'alcohol induced' aliens that will gradually progress towards a town to raid a brewery. The protagonist is a drunk that frequently visits the establishment to obtain his share of the 'frothy' goodness. The game will be programmed entirely in python.

- ###### General Description

  The game will have a menu screen. The menu will have a start game option. The game will commence once the user clicks the start option. The game will have both menu and in-game music. The player will have animations for walking left and right. The protagonist will have to obtain from blimps that enter the playing area at random intervals.

  After shooting the blimp, the protagonist will have to collide with the falling powerup to collect the special. Specials will be extra health, score multiplier(optional feature), rapid shooting, and an overhead protective barrier. The barrier will only protect against a certain amount of attacks before it blows up.

  The aliens will move towards ground level at a side to side movement and shoot at the player at random. "Beer Defender" will start each wave of enemies with a specific amount of beers (contained in crates). The beer(s) represent the player's current health, and a beer will be removed when the player is hit with an enemy laser. The game is over when the player loses all beers. When an enemy collides with the player, meaning it successfully reached the player's height, then the player loses all his beers (health) and it is game over.  

  The player will have a gun to shoot back at the enemies. After a certain amount of enemy waves, the game will continue in space with the player controlling a spacecraft. The player will attempt to defeat a large spaceship. The large spaceship will be the final boss. The boss will have a heavy attack (missiles) and light attack(lasers). During the fight, some smaller spaceships will enter the playing area and attempt to kill the player.
